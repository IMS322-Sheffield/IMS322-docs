# Using Replit
[Replit](https://replit.com) is the code editor that we will be using this semester. You will be using Replit to accept and submit all coding assignments and do in-class group exercises in a shared editor. This greatly simplifies several aspects of developing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including setup, previewing, troubleshooting, submitting, and collaborating. You will be sent an invite link to create your Replit account during the first day of class.
