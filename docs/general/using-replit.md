# Using Replit
[Replit](https://replit.com) is the code editor that we will be using this semester for all coding exercises and assignments. It is a browser-based IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which means that all HTML/CSS/JS editing, debugging, and previewing will be done within your web browser. You will be sent an invite link to create your Replit account during the first day of class. All of the content below assumes that you are logged in to Replit using your class account.

## Creating a New Repl
Each individual project in Replit is called a "Repl".  To create a new Repl for practice or in-class exercises, simply go to the [IMS322 template](https://replit.com/@sheffie/IMS322-Template) and click the "Fork" button. Enter a new name for the Repl when prompted. This will create a new copy of the template in your account, which includes a customized `index.html` file and the `ims322-style.css` file (more on that [here](css-framework)).

If for some reason you want to make a fresh Repl without any of the customizations in the IMS322 template, click the "Create Repl" button in the upper-left corner of the Replit home page. When prompted, choose the "HTML, CSS, JS" template and enter a title.

You can find all personal Repls in the "My Repls" category in the lefthand sidebar on your Replit home page.
## Accepting and Submitting Assignments
When your Replit account is created, you will be added to the class "Team". You can see the projects assigned to your team by clicking on "Teams" in the lefthand sidebar on your Replit home page.

To accept an assignment, 

Each assignment will be built from the IMS 322 Repl template and include instructions and possibly some additional comments or example code in the HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript files. *Make sure that you carefully read these.*
