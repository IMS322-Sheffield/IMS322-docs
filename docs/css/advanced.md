# Advanced CSS
The topics on this page are not terribly complicated but are being categorized as "advanced" since they might not have been covered in all sections of IMS222. We will cover a portion of these topics during the first few weeks of the semester, pending the results of the IMS322 Review Survey (the first assignment in Canvas). Below, you will find brief descriptions and embedded examples for each topic.
## Relative units
As noted on the [Review](docs/general/review#relative-units) and [Style Guide](docs/general/style-guide#use-flexible-and-relative-units-whenever-possible) pages, using relative units by default will often make layout spacing and element sizing more consistent, cohesive, and flexible. In the embedded example below, each `<div>` has been sized using one of the relative units recommended for this class:
- `%` - Percentage relative to the parent element. 
- `ch` - The width of the number "0" of the element's font.
- `rem`	- Relative to the default browser font size.
- `vw` - 1% of the viewport's (window) width.
- `vh` - 1% of the viewport's (window) height.

Try adjusting the different width and height properties in the `style.css` file of this example Repl to see how they affect the resulting size of each `<div>`.
