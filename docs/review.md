# Review
Before we start working with JavaScript, this class assumes some familiarity with the HTML, CSS, and general web browser concepts below. We will review much of this content at the beginning of the semester.
## HTML
### Basic tags/elements 
Excerpted from Kevin Powell's ["The Only Tags You Need to Know (for now)"](the-only-tags-that-you-need-to-know-for-now.pdf)
- Metadata tags: `<html>` `<head>` `<title>` `<link>` `<body>`
- Content tags: `<h1>`...`<h6>` `<p>` `<a>` `<ol>` `<ul>` `<li>` `<img>`
- Layout tags: `<header>` `<main>` `<footer>` `<nav>` `<section>` `<div>`

#### Semantic HTML
[Semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantics_in_html) tags describe meaning, contextualizing the contents of the element. They also improve accessibility for people that use screen readers. Try to use the most appropriate semantic tags whenever possible.
### Attributes
- `alt`: alternate text for an `<img>` tag
- `class`: for use as a selector in CSS
- `href`: url for `<a>` tags
- `id`: for use as a query in JavaScript
- `src`: path to image to be displayed for `<img>` tags

## CSS Box Model
The CSS Box Model describes how margin, border, padding, and content relate to each other in an HTML element.
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"> 
  <figure style="max-width: 500px;">
	  <img src="images/CSS-Box-Model.webp" style="width: 100%;">
  </figure>
</div>
