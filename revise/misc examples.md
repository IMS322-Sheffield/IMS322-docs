# Miscellaneous Examples
This page includes a collection of basic examples for unique scenarios that fall outside of the regular course content. They will not be covered during class but can be adopted and modified for assignments as needed.
## Click to Reveal
Uses `position: absolute` to place one element on top of another, then changes the top element's opacity to make it appear as though the bottom element is being revealed. *Be very careful* when using `position: absolute`. It should only be implemented when absolutely necessary. Layout positioning may become unpredictable when modifying the position property.
