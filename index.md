# IMS322 Documentation

## Welcome

This site consists of a collection of instructions, tips, and examples for IMS322 with Dr. Eric Sheffield. Content relevant to the current topic in the class will generally be assigned on a weekly basis through Canvas. Supplemental material is also available on the [Additional Resources](general/resources) page and can be perused at your leisure if you are looking for additional help, review, or inspiration.
