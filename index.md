# IMS322 Documentation

## Welcome
This site consists of a collection of instructions, tips, and examples for IMS322 with Dr. Eric Sheffield. The purpose of this site is not to duplicate existing resources but rather summarize and customize information for our needs. As such, reading and practice content from this site assigned in Canvas may be combined with material from other online resources.

Throughout this site, you will find embedded examples from CodePen called "Pens." It is important that you look at both the code and rendered previews in these examples and try changing values and properties in the code - you can edit the code in place and see your changes reflected in the preview! For responsive examples (e.g. using flexbox or media queries), you should open the preview in a larger window by clicking "EDIT ON CODEPEN." If you are logged in to CodePen, you can then click the "Fork" button at the bottom to create a copy of the Pen in your own account if needed.
