# IMS322 Documentation

## Welcome
This site consists of a collection of instructions, tips, and examples for IMS322 with Dr. Eric Sheffield. The purpose of this site is not to duplicate existing resources but rather summarize and customize information for our needs. As such, reading and practice content from this site assigned in Canvas will often be combined with material from other online resources.

Supplemental material is available on the [Additional Resources](resources) page and can be perused at your leisure if you are looking for additional help, review, or inspiration.
