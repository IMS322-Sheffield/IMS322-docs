## Changes
- Probably need 3 weeks for review? What kind of assignments can fit in here?
- Multiple notes say things felt rushed, so going down to 4 projects probably makes sense
- Readings and practice should include submissions - perhaps a quick CodePen that changes 1 thing?
- Make their own design documentation structure?
- More distinct rules for images e.g. MUST be high-quality, cannot exceed the height of the window, credit images or use AI, etc.
- Syllabus should clarify what workdays are for?
- More time troubleshooting - there should also be assignments that use the Developer Tools
- Do not use autofill when teaching - makes sense
- Use comments more effectively?
- Store in-class codings the same as other assignments - try to reduce the amount of template forking
- They enjoyed seeing utilities demonstrated e.g. Squoosh
